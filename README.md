# Hand Gesture Recognition System

This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition and finger counting system developed using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It can recognize basic hand gestures such as "Thumbs Up", "Hi", "Fist", and "Open Hand", and count the number of fingers shown. The project provides two interfaces:
- A local desktop application (using OpenCV window)
- A web-based application (using Streamlit)

## Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking
- Finger counting (1 to 5 fingers)
- Gesture recognition (Thumbs Up, Hi, Fist, Open Hand)
- Web-based interface using Streamlit
- Lightweight and easy to set up
